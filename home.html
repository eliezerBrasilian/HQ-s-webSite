          A comic book, also called comicbook,[1][2] comic magazine or (in the
          United Kingdom and Ireland) simply comic, is a publication that
          consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels
          that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by
          descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialogue contained
          in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although comics
          have some origins in 18th century in Eastern Asia, comic books were
          first popularized[disputed – discuss] in the United States and the
          United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, Famous
          Funnies, was released in the US in 1933 and was a reprinting of
          earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of
          the story-telling devices used in comics.[3] The term comic book
          derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic
          strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by
          featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

          The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in
          Japan was valued at ¥586.4 billion ($6–7 billion),[4] with annual
          sales of 1.9 billion manga books (tankōbon volumes and manga
          magazines) in Japan, equivalent to 15 issues per person.[5] In 2020
          the manga market in Japan reached a new record value of ¥612.5 billion
          due to a fast growth of digital manga sales as well as an increase in
          print sales.[6][7] The comic book market in the United States and
          Canada was valued at $1.09 billion in 2016.[8] Beginning with the late
          2010s manga started massively outselling American comics.[9]As of
          2017, the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga
          distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics.[10]
          The best-selling comic book categories in the US as of 2019 are
          juvenile children's fiction at 41%, manga at 28% and superhero comics
          at 10% of the market.[11] Another major comic book market is France,
          where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of
          the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.[12].
