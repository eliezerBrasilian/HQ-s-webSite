        Falcon (Samuel Thomas "Sam" Wilson) is a superhero character appearing
        in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
        introduced by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan in Captain
        America #117 (Sept. 1969), and was the first Black American superhero in
        mainstream comic books.[1][2] Samuel Wilson, or known as his superhero
        alias Falcon, uses mechanical wings to fly, defend, and attack, he also
        has limited telepathic and empathic control over birds. After Steve
        Rogers retires, Wilson becomes Captain America in All-New Captain
        America #1 (Jan. 2015) and leader of the Avengers. Wilson's deceased
        nephew was the Incredible Hulk's sometime-sidekick Jim Wilson, one of
        the first openly HIV-positive comic-book characters. Jim Wilson's father
        Gideon Wilson would go on to join the Gamma Corps. Font (wikipedia)

        Jean is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are
        born with superhuman abilities. She was born with telepathic and
        telekinetic powers. Her powers first manifested when she saw her
        childhood friend being hit by a car. She is a caring, nurturing figure,
        but she also has to deal with being an Omega-level mutant and the
        physical manifestation of the cosmic Phoenix Force. Jean experienced a
        transformation into the Phoenix in the X-Men storyline "The Dark Phoenix
        Saga". She has faced death numerous times in the history of the series.
        Her first death was under her guise as Marvel Girl, when she died and
        was "reborn" as Phoenix in "The Dark Phoenix Saga". This transformation
        led to her second death, which was suicide, though not her last. Font

        Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books
        published by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack
        Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover
        dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics.
        Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often
        fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most
        popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of
        superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic book
        was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since
        Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has
        remained in publication. Font (wikipedia)
